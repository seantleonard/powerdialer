Auto calling Applescript built for the Mac app "Telephone"


You must first download the application "Telephone" from the Mac AppStore: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/telephone/id406825478?mt=12

In the script, you must replace the phone number with the phone number of the radio station you desire.

Example:

KROQ: 1-800-520-1067

	To create multiple phone lines and identifiable line windows for the script to recognize, enter each phone number like so:

		Line 1: 180052010671  <-- notice the 1
		Line 2: 180052010672  <-- notice the 2

		etc.

		However, due to restrictions in the app, you can only add up to 7 additional lines without some lines failing during runtime.
